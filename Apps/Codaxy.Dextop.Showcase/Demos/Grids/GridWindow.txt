Basic Grid Window
=================

In order to create grid for viewing server-side data, you need to:

1. Define the model class on the server-side;
2. Define CRUD methods on the server-side (in this example grid only Read method is implemented as grid is readonly);
3. Define the store and the grid on the client-side, using the model.
