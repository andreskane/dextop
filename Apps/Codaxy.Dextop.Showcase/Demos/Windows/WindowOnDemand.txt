Window On Demand
================

This demo shows one technique that can be used to create and show Dextop windows on user's demand.
Typically, one would have Window Factory in the server-side Session class, and create windows 
in a [DextopRemotable] method like CreateWindow. The type of the window (as well as all the required
parameters) can be passed as the argument to the remote method, just like in this example.
