File Download Demo
================

Programmatic downloads are usually done using window.open(url) method, which opens a new tab in the browser.
Using Dextop.downloadAttachment method it's possible to download files directly using injected iframe 
element. However as iframe is not designed for downloading files, only files with 

	Content-Disposition: attachment

header can be downloaded this way, or static files which cannot be displayed inside iframe (e.g. .zip files).
