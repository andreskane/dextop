====================

This demo shows all form field types supported by Dextop.



### Remote Lookup Combo

When form is displayed combo store is not loaded and description lookup 
cannot be made. If description is available inside initial form data then
it is possible to use valueNotFoundField in the field attribute to 
specify the name of the field which holds the description for the current 
inital lookup value.
