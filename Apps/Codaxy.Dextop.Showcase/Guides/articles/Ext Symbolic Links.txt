# Including Ext as a symbolic link

Ext 4 download package is very big, over 100 MB unpacked.
If you're working on more than one Ext based application, 
then a lot of disk space is wasted.
In order to save space NTFS symbolic links can be used.

NTFS symbolic link (symlink) is a filesystem object in the NTFS filesystem that points to another filesystem object. 

## How to create an Ext symbolic link

Unpack Ext somewhere outside your project repository (e.g. C:\Ext\ext-4.0.1).

To create a symbolic link follow these few simple steps:

1. Open Command Prompt in Administrator Mode
2. Change directory to 'client\lib' folder of your application.
3. Type <pre>mklink %CD%\ext C:\Ext\ext-4.0.1 /D</pre>
4. Make sure that ext folder is ignored if you're using svn or git 

Ext folder should appear with a shortcut overlay. 

To delete the link simply delete the folder.
