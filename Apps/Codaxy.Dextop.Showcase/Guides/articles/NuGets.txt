We are providing few NuGet packages which can be used to quickly setup new Dextop applications.

NuGets are available through the official [NuGet feed](http://nuget.org/List/Packages/Dextop.Template.Basic). 

## Setting up a new Dextop application

To setup a new Dextop application use following steps:

#### 1. Open up Visual Studio and create new "ASP.NET Empty Web Application" project

Make sure .NET 4 Framework is selected. You should get an empty project, with just one file (Web.config).

#### 2. Install Dextop by adding NuGet Library Package Reference

Right-click on project References and select Add Library Package Reference.
Search for Dextop and then select and install an appropriate project template Nuget.
After installing your project should look like the standard ASP.NET MVC 3 application.

#### 3. Download and unpack Ext JS 

Ext JS library can be downloaded from the [Sencha website](http://www.sencha.com). 
Use latest version of Ext JS 4 library and unpack it's contents to '/client/lib/ext' directory of your application,
or include ext as a symbolic link (guide).

#### 4. Run the application
Hit F5 to start the application. If everything went well you should see some Ext content appearing.

**Note:** After installing you shouldn't update the project template as it will revert some of the project files to default content. Update only the library packages.
