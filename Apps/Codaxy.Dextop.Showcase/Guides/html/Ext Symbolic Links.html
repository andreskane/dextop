<h1>Including Ext as a symbolic link</h1>

<p>Ext 4 download package is very big, over 100 MB unpacked.
If you're working on more than one Ext based application, 
then a lot of disk space is wasted.
In order to save space NTFS symbolic links can be used.</p>

<p>NTFS symbolic link (symlink) is a filesystem object in the NTFS filesystem that points to another filesystem object. </p>

<h2>How to create an Ext symbolic link</h2>

<p>Unpack Ext somewhere outside your project repository (e.g. C:\Ext\ext-4.0.1).</p>

<p>To create a symbolic link follow these few simple steps:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open Command Prompt in Administrator Mode</li>
<li>Change directory to 'client\lib' folder of your application.</li>
<li>Type <pre>mklink %CD%\ext C:\Ext\ext-4.0.1 /D</pre></li>
<li>Make sure that ext folder is ignored if you're using svn or git </li>
</ol>

<p>Ext folder should appear with a shortcut overlay. </p>

<p>To delete the link simply delete the folder.</p>
