Dextop DateTime handling
------------------------

DateTime JSON handling in Dextop is customized.

Ext sends dates in ISO 8601 format 'yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss', so it's natural 
that Dextop use IsoDateTimeConverter. his results with an issue that
date is written as string and it is not converted to js Date object.

JavaScriptDateTimeConverter sends dates as new Date(ticks), which are 
recognized by the browser and converted to dates. But, JavaScriptDateTimeConverter
cannot parse dates sent by the browser (sent in ISO format).

DextopDateTimeConverter sends dates using JavaScriptDateTimeConverter.
DextopDateTimeConverter parses dates using IsoDateTimeConverter.
